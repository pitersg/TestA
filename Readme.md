
SUMMARY
---------

I have selected the Exercsive A.

The files created for the exercsice are the following ones:

-Test Report Template
	Excel File which reflects the rules specified in the scenario, there has been defined functional test to cover this scenario.
	In a real scenario non functional test could be considered into the scope.
	
- AuxFunctions.py 
	Phyton file in which are listed all the functions needed to implement the code

- Main.py
	Phyton file which executes the Tasks to perform the scenarios listed whithin the Test Report Template
	
-Test for automation skills
	Last page of the guidelines has been filled (General knowledge chapter)
	
- Exercise A3.md
    Text File in which is specified the procedure to open and notify a bug
	


EXERCISE A: PART 1 CLARIFICATIONS
---------------------------------

NOTE: Due to the amount of time available for me ( I am working from 08:00 - 16:30) I have not developed the complete functionality of the automated testcase. 
      However, the Architecture needed has been developed as well the parameters to make this code reusable.


	 To develop the automatization there would be needed to use the following libraries

		- beautifulsoup: for data scrapping (to dump the article data information from the website)	
		
				I have no experience with web data scrapping, so I would need more time to make familiar with this library functions.
				It would not be a problem to learn this library ussage 
				
		- Pandas: for excel handling (to store the reports in excel format)
				I have experience with this library, It would not be a problem to implement excel data exporting with pandas (or xlsxwriter) to create and automatizate reports


		
Individual Variables with the Test Cases results and functions have been defined in the phyton files.
To fit this architecture in another type of scenario only would be needed to change the input parameters in the code.


EXERCISE A: Part 2 CLARIFICATIONS
----------------------------------
Test Cases can be found inside of the Test Report.
There have been consireded only functional tests for this exercise.


EXERCISE A: Part 3 CLARIFICATIONS
----------------------------------
The procedure to open a bug has been specified within the file "exercise A3.md"


EXERCISE A: Part 4 CLARIFICATIONS
----------------------------------
